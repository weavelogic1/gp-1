			<p>People in village were afraid to enter a house where once lived a witch with her child. It was said that she sacrificed her own child to get mystic powers. Hearing this, a violent mob lynched her. After this incident it was rumored that her ghost still lives in that house and haunts any passerby. A group of young thrill seekers volunteered to go inside the house to solve the mysteries.</p>
